For this assignment we were asked to create a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour in their work day. Additionally, the hour blocks should change color as time moves throughout the day; red for present hour, greay for past and green for future. Even after the page is refreshed, events should be saved and appear on the screen automatically.
